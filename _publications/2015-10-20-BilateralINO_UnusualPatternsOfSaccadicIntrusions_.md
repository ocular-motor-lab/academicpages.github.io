### Abstract: 
The signals for adduction during conjugate horizontal eye movements are carried through the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF). Lesions in this pathway cause internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO), characterized by impaired ipsilesional adduction, often with nystagmus of the contralateral abducting eye. Usually with INO straight-ahead fixation appears steady. Here we demonstrate quantitative recordings and videos of 2 unusual patterns of saccadic intrusions in a patient with bilateral INO and discuss a plausible mechanism.
