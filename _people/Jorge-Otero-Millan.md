Jorge Otero-Millan is Assistant Professor of Optometry and Vision Science at UC Berkeley. He is also affiliated with the Department of Neurology at Johns Hopkins University. He aims to understand how and why we move our eyes and how eye movements affect visual perception. He focuses on the small eye movements we make when we try to keep them still or when we tilt our head. Because of these movements, images on the retina continuously move, rotate, and jump. Otero-Millan studies how the brain maintains a stable perception despite this motion. He is also interested in how eye movements can be used to diagnose patients with various disorders. He has developed new methods to better measure and analyze eye movements. He received his BSc in Telecommunication Engineering from University of Vigo in Spain in 2006 and his PhD in Neuroscience from University of Vigo in collaboration with the Barrow Neurological Institute in 2013. Following a postdoc at Hopkins, he joined the UCB School of Optometry in 2020.
