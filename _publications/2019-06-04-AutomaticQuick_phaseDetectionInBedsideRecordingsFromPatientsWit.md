Abstract: Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV) is the most common cause of vertigo. It can be diagnosed and treated with simple maneuvers done by vestibular experts. However, there is a high rate of misdiagnosis that results in high medical costs from unnecessary neuroimaging tests. Here we show how to improve saccade detection methods for automatic detection of quick-phases of nystagmus, a key sign of BPPV. We test our method using eye movement data recorded in patients during the diagnostic maneuver.
